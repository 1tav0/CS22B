Problem 0.0.0
Description of problem:
a few lines describing input, activity, and output of the program
*/

Each function except main should have a function header similar to this
example:

/* ******************** getSize ********************
asks user for size
size saved in calling function via reference parameter
*/

Problem1.1
Write a program containing the following functions:
main - calls the other functions; otherwise does nothing
getSize - which asks the user how many strings they want
getSpace - which gets an array in the heap of the size requested by the user
inputData - which allows the user to input the strings and stores them
in the array
printData - which prints all the strings, one string per line
destroy - which returns all the space to the heap

All of these functions, except main, shall have a return type of void.
Put the main function first.
Use the function names specified above.
Arrange the functions in the order listed above.
