Use the same format for problem and function headings as lab 1.

      Problem 2.1
Declare a structure with a type name: Car
containing:

reportingMark 	  a string of 5 or less upper case characters
carNumber 	  an int
kind 	  could be box tank flat or other
loaded 	  a bool
destination 	  a string with a destination or the word NONE

Note: A destination is required if the car is loaded. If it is not
loaded the destination may be either a destination or the word NONE.

Create the following functions:

main

  * Uses new to obtain space for the data structure
  * Calls the other two functions
  * Deletes the space obtained using new

input

  * Read all the data from the user
  * After all the data has been read, put all this data into the structure

output

  * Print the data in a neat format

Put the main function first.
Use the function names and field names specified above.
Arrange the functions in the order listed above.

Test your program with the following data:

reportingMark 	  SP
carNumber 	  34567
kind 	  box
loaded 	  true
destination 	  Salt Lake City

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Problem 2.2
Repeat problem 2.1 with the following changes:

Use class rather than struct with the type name:   Car
Make the data in the class Car public.
Revise the input so the input function will only read the data from the
user, and then it will call an additional function named setUpCar which
will put the data in the object.

Test with the same data.
